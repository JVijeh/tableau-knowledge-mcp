## 🎯 Tips for Effective Queries

1. **Be Specific**: Reference specific books if you know them
   - "Search my 'Learning Tableau 2025' book for..."

2. **Combine Theory + Practice**: Ask for both explanation and application
   - "Explain X from my books, then demonstrate with my data"

3. **Request Examples**: Ask for concrete examples
   - "Show me 3 different ways to calculate..."

4. **Iterate**: Build on previous answers
   - "Now apply that same technique to a different field"

5. **Ask for Comparisons**: Compare multiple approaches
   - "Show me the difference between method A and method B"

## 📊 Expected Results

When queries work correctly, you should see:

1. **Knowledge Base Results**: 
   - Relevant book excerpts
   - Page numbers and sources
   - Specific examples from your PDFs

2. **Tableau Results**:
   - Actual data from your datasources
   - Field metadata
   - Query results in tabular format

3. **Synthesized Insights**:
   - Claude combining both sources
   - Practical recommendations
   - Code examples you can use

## 🐛 If Queries Don't Work

**Knowledge Base Returns Nothing:**
- Check if PDFs were indexed correctly
- Verify server is running (🔌 icon)
- Try simpler query: "List all books"

**Tableau Returns Errors:**
- Verify PAT credentials in config
- Check server URL and site name
- Test with simpler query: "List datasources"

**Both Servers Show as Disconnected:**
- Restart Claude Desktop completely
- Check configuration file paths
- Review logs for error messages
